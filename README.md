Three simple yet powerful Python scripts that can save you time every day:

1. rename_files.py
Automatically rename all files in a folder â€“ perfect for photos, invoices, or exported data.

2. send_email.py
Send an automated email using Python. Use a Gmail "app password" for added security.

3. get_weather.py
Fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap and display the temperature and description.

ðŸ”§ Tips
Use pip install requests if you donâ€™t already have the requests module installed.

For scripts 2 & 3, youâ€™ll need a Gmail app password and an OpenWeatherMap API key.

Good luck!
